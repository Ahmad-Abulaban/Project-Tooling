# Task2

## Q1

## What is Visual Studio Code, and how does it work?

**Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring are among the features.**


## What is Visual Studio Code's purpose?

**Visual Studio Code is a lightweight code editor that includes features for debugging, task execution, and version management. It attempts to provide developers only the tools they need to complete a fast code-build-debug cycle.**

***

## What is PyCharm?

**PyCharm is an integrated development environment for computer programming, with a focus on the Python programming language. JetBrains, a Czech firm, created it.**


## Why is PyCharm used?

**offering a comfortable environment for effective Python, web, and data science development by tightly integrating a large range of important tools for Python developers.**

***

# IDE

## What's the difference between PyCharm and Visual Studio Code?

**Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is considerably quicker. When compared to PyCharm, it is incredibly light. Visual Studio Code is the clear victor when it comes to a modular approach to wiring code. Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE) contains a large number of extensions, add-ons, and other libraries.**

***

# The difference between them in detail?

* Performance

**PyCharm needs approximately 1 GB of RAM, whereas VS Code seldom exceeds 300 MB.**

**PyCharm is easily beaten by VS Code. Because VS Code doesn't pretend to be an IDE and instead focuses on being a text editor, it has a considerably smaller memory footprint, startup time, and general responsiveness than PyCharm.**

## Winner: VS Code

***

* Extensibility

**VS Code is a stripped-down editor that may be expanded into a full-fledged IDE with the help of plugins. A single addon provides complete Python functionality (including syntax highlighting, debugging, and code completion). VS Code offers extensions for nearly everything, and developers may easily create their own. The VS Code Marketplace has all of these extensions. As a result, VS Code is considerably more expandable than PyCharm.**

## Winner: VS Code

***

* User-friendliness

**PyCharm contains a lot of capabilities that most people don't use on a daily basis, and finding out where to locate the configuration choices if you haven't used it before may be a little difficult. It's a lot easier to figure out how to configure VS Code. Simply press Ctrl+Shift+P to bring up a command palette where you may search for whatever you want to perform, and it will appear in the results.**

## Winner: VS Code

***

* Price

**PyCharm is about $200 per year. There is a community version of PyCharm that is free to use commercially, but it lacks many of the features that make PyCharm appealing (such as remote debugging, sophisticated Django support, and support for JavaScript and CSS). VS Code, on the other hand, is a free and open-source application.**

## Winner: VS Code

***

## Final

**VS Code provides virtually all of the capabilities of PyCharm at a far lower cost and with significantly better performance.**

***

# Operating System

## What exactly is Linux? 

**The Linux kernel is the foundation for a range of open-source Unix-like operating systems.**

## What is the purpose of using it?

**Linux is used to power portions of the Internet as well as small and big networks in businesses, organizations, and homes.**

***

## What is Windows?

**Microsoft Windows, or just Windows, is a collection of proprietary graphical operating systems created and distributed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain area of computing.**

## Why we use windows?

**Windows allows you to surf the web, check your email, edit digital photographs, listen to music, play games, and much more. Many workplaces use Windows because it provides access to productivity tools like calendars, word processors, and spreadsheets.**

***

## Linux vs. Windows: What's the Difference?

**Linux is an open source operating system, whereas Windows is a proprietary operating system. Linux has access to the source code and may change it to suit the needs of the user, but Windows does not. In Linux, the user has access to the kernel's source code and may modify it to suit his needs.**

***

| Linux      | Windows |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The operating system Linux is free and open source. | The operating system Windows is not open source. |
| Linux is a completely free operating system.   | Windows it is costly.|
| The case of the file name is sensitive. | Its file name is case-insensitive. |
| Monolithic kernels are used in Linux. | microkernel is used.|
| Linux is more efficient. | windows are less efficient. |
| Linux provides security | windows provides less security  |

## Github

**Github is a web-based application that allows users to save their projects in a Git repository that others may view. Other developers may use Github to learn, contribute, and share their work with the community. Git commands may be used to control the Git repository from inside an IDE that supports Version Control, such as Visual Studio.**

## GitLab:

**GitLab is a Version control platform that works similar to Github, GitLab makes it easier to import code hosted in other websites which Github cannot.**



| GitHub      | GitLab |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| With openly accessible codes, GitHub projects are free and available to anyone. | GitLab is a code repository for web developers alone. |
| In the free plan, GitHub does not enable you to locate a repository within an organization. | While utilizing the free plan, GitLab allows users to find a repository within an organization. |
| The issue tracker supports pulling requests, which means that when issues are merged to another repository, they are automatically closed. | The issue tracker allows users to link issues to PRs so that they can be closed automatically. |
| GitHub publications are arranged into a series of guidelines, each of which focuses on a different platform. | GitLab docs are similar to language documentation in that they provide a search bar and a list of all the documents needed by the installation. |
