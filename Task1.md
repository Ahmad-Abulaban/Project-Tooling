## Q1- 

# ( Hand Made App ) 

* This idea provides for the production of a platform/application for handmade makers in all its forms by displaying their products on the platform/application and ensuring that the made products reach the customers through dealing with a delivery company to make it easier for the product manufacturer to produce more product.

* The application will include many advantages for the product maker from He can monitor sales and views with the percentage of buyers per view.

### technique:-

* What is Waterfall?

**The Waterfall Model is followed in a sequential order, the project development team will only go on to the next phase of development or testing if the previous step has been successfully completed.**

* What is the Agile?

**Agile methodology is a strategy that aids in the software development process by allowing for continuous iteration of development and testing. This method helps consumers, developers, managers, and testers to communicate more effectively.**


| Difference between Agile and Waterfall Model:     |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| It takes a step-by-step method. | a way of designing in a progressive order. |
| The project development life cycle is divided into sprints. | There are several stages to the software development process. |
| its flexibility. | It has the potential to be extremely inflexible. |
| Agile may be thought of as a collection of several projects. | The development of software will be done as a single project. |
| After each sprint, the test plan is evaluated. | During the testing phase, the test strategy is rarely addressed. |
| The test team may easily participate in requirement changes. | Any change in requirements is tough for the test to begin. |

## In my project I will use Waterfall methodology because it has a lot of features which are:

### Advantages of Waterfall Model:

1. It's one of the simplest models to work with. Each phase has particular deliverables and a review procedure due to its nature.
2. Project completion in a shorter amount of time.
3. It works effectively for tiny projects with simple needs.
4. Both the process and the outcomes are extensively recorded.	
5. When it comes to managing dependencies, this project management technique comes in handy.
6. Method for reorganizing teams that is easily adaptable.

***

### Testing technique:-

**The testing technique I used in my project is Black Box Testing.**


## what is black box testing?

**Black Box Testing is a software testing approach that involves testing the functionality of software applications without knowing the internal code structure, implementation details, or internal pathways. Black Box Testing is a form of software testing that is entirely driven by software requirements and specifications and focuses on the input and output of software applications. Behavioral testing is another name for it.**



| Advantages of black box testing:     | 
| ----------- |
| Extremely effective. | 
| Customer satisfaction is achieved. |
| Nice revenue, good product. | 
| Quality  |
| Optimization of the business. | 
| Experience of the user. |
